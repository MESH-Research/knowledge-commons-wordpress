Recommended install:

cd
git clone git@github.com:mlaa/dev-scripts.git
ln -s dev-scripts/commons/sync.bash sync.bash
ln -s dev-scripts/commons/all_networks_wp.bash all_networks_wp.bash


sync.bash usage:

If this is the first time you've used it, read the source of sync.bash - there are a few setup steps required, detailed in a comment at the top of the file.

Sync database & files from production, and activate dev-related plugins (equal to -dfp):
~/sync.bash

Same as above, but sync from stage (this works with -d and -f as well):
~/sync.bash -S

Sync database only from production:
~/sync.bash -d

Sync files only from production:
~/sync.bash -f

Import a local existing database dump without doing anything in production:
~/sync.bash -l

Activate some dev-related plugins & deactivate a couple that you probably don't want (like password-protected):
~/sync.bash -p

Note that sync.bash depends on all_networks_wp.bash to flush cache & deal with plugins.

<h2>Welcome to the DH2020 virtual conference!</h2>
<p>In this unbelievable year, our conference plans and preparations were upended by events that none of us could have anticipated. We thought we would be gathering this week in Ottawa to share our work and ideas, to connect with colleagues, and to visit with friends. But here we are, both everywhere and nowhere, and while we wonâ€™t be able to get together for coffee or dinner, we can still share our research, encourage discourse, and celebrate the groundbreaking work that is being done across methods and disciplines that we identify with the Digital Humanities.

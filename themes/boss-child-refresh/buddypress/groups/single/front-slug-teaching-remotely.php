<p>This group is a place to share experiences, ask questions, and create collective resources related to teaching remotely as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our work. We hope you will bring your own ideas and questions to create new discussion topics or propose further initiatives within the group.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://mla.hcommons.org/groups/teaching-remotely/forum/">discussion</a> tab houses the forum where you can participate in conversations. Whether you have questions about institutional policies, course content, or just want to discuss what teachers are feeling throughout the year, you can start threads for conversation there.Â </p>

<p>The <a href="https://mla.hcommons.org/groups/teaching-remotely/deposits/"><em>CORE</em> collection</a> tab is where you can view deposits that have been shared with the group. To add to the collection, upload materials to <a href="https://mla.hcommons.org/core/"><em>CORE</em></a> and share them with this group. You can share a wide range of materials in <em>CORE</em>, from syllabi, to assignments and projects, to blog posts and articles.</p>

<p>In July 2021, the group hosted a Teaching Remotely <em>CORE</em> Deposit Party. Instructors were invited to deposit specific materials and to share their thoughts on questions about transitioning their courses during the pandemic. We are very thankful for those who participated and deposited material to <em>CORE</em>, and we also hope to hold events such as this in the future. You can read more about the <em>CORE</em> deposit party in <a href="https://thewire.mla.hcommons.org/teaching-remotely-core-deposit-party-recap/">this post</a> on the <em>MLA Commons</em> Wire blog. </p>

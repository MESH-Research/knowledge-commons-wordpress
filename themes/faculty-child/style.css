-- Stylesheet locations --

Add your own customizations into /css/custom.css in this child theme.

Parent styles are called from /functions.php in the
parent theme and are located in /css/ in the parent theme.

--- The styles are loaded in the following order ---
-- CHILD THEME --

custom.css

The later on a stylesheet is loaded, the higher precedent it gets.
So for example, if you define a CSS element in custom.css that has already
been defined in main-global.css, the version in custom.css will be used.

Each stylesheet includes a table of contents to help you navigate
through it. You will notice that many of them include a section with
media queries. Media queries allow us to detect a browser's screen
size, and load specific styles only if the screen is larger or smaller
than that particular size. This allows us to define a large set of
global styles, and then specific styles for phones, tablets,
and desktops & laptops - just based on the predicted screen size
of these devices. That's boss!
